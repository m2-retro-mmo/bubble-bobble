# Bubble Bobble

Bubble Bobble is an Massive Multiplayer online game that was developed by a Team of 6 people during a student project at the HTW.

# Features

Bubble Bobble is an MMO Game created with Unity.
The objective of the game is to collect **diamonds** scattered on a **randomly generated map**.
The map features various **obstacles and terrains**, adding an extra layer of challenge to the gameplay.

Players are split evenly into **two teams**. If necessary, the remaining characters will be filled in with **bots**, up to a certain total number. Each bot is capable to play the game autonomously and has a unique set of objectives and strategies that are randomly assigned at the start of the game.
With a combination of teamwork, strategy, and quick thinking, players must outsmart and outmaneuver their opponents to collect the most diamonds and win the game.

**Bubble Bobble reloaded** features a robust network code, which was integrated into the game with the help of the [**Mirror**](https://mirror-networking.com/) library.
This allows for seamless multiplayer functionality, ensuring that players can enjoy the game together with minimal lag.

The game is characterized by several hand-crafted assets and performant frame-based animations, ensuring that the game runs smoothly and efficiently, even with a large number of players.
In addition, we have added intuitive UI elements to the game to enhance the player experience. Overall, our efforts have resulted in a polished and entertaining game that players can enjoy for hours.
